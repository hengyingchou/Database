I feel like this is a good experience that we can physically use cloud database 
computation. However, there are pros and corns of this. For one thing, cloud 
service can provide us some powerful computational infrasture. I can use it anywhere 
with internet. But, in the other side, because it is provided via internet, if internet is not 
stable, the connection with server would be bad. One more thing is that, becasue we share the 
computation resource from the server. Sometimes, the speed of the server would be slow.
